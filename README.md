Flask-based Book Management System

This project is a web-based system developed using Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python. It connects to a MongoDB database hosted on MongoDB Atlas, offering seamless CRUD operations for managing books. The key features include:

Book Retrieval: Users can search for books based on multiple parameters such as title, author, and genre. The system incorporates pagination to ensure efficient data retrieval without overwhelming the client.

Genre Listing: There's a dedicated endpoint that fetches distinct genres from the database, permitting users to filter books accordingly.

CRUD Operations: The system facilitates creating, reading, updating, and deleting books. Each book is identified by a unique identifier, simplifying reference and access.

Data Export and Import: Users have the ability to export their book collections in either CSV or JSON formats. Furthermore, they can import data in bulk, streamlining data migration.

Challenges: Initially, I lacked knowledge of both Flask and Next.js. then i took approaches like: reading relevant blogs and exploring YouTube tutorials.
These strategies equipped me with a foundational understanding of the technologies. 
As I embarked on the project, whenever I encountered challenges, I turned to the internet for guidance. 
Each challenge provided a learning opportunity, helping me identify the underlying issue and its potential solutions. 
This iterative process of learning and applying enabled me to complete my assessment successfully.
